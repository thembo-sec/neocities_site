# Why would I write a blog

So over the last few months, i've found myself writing more often. Nothing of particular consequence, just whatever is popping into my head on any given day.

But for whatever reason, rather than screaming into the void (read: scribbling into my moleskin notebook), I figured i'd scream into the void (the horror that is the world wide web).

```python
def function():
    x: int = 1
    return x+1
```
