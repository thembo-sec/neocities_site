# Moving my body through time

This book makes me feel less alone whenever I read it.

Whenever I open it, i want to start highlighting portions of it, quoting them, but quickly come to realise that I would simply end up writing most of the book word for word down. Its warm, reading it feels like a slow summer afternoon on a day that is hot but not *too* hot.

> Hey, I live in a house with a door!

I am reminded of my urge to share my small experiences of the world, like the child, so excited to share theirs. *Time is a Thing* feels like it encapsulates so many possible forms of intimacy in a way that is almost aspirational.

## Bodies like mine

The first time I read this book was possibly one of the first times I felt truly seen. At the time I didn't know many people like myself, *"people with complicated genders"*. Not only do I feel some sense of kinship with the narrator in the way they describe themselves, but also in the way that complicates the relationship they have with queerness and they way they move their body through time and space.

> One of the reasons I’m thinking about this is that I’m not supposed to be next to anyone, in the sense that I never knew people like me existed, so I never imagined myself next to someone or not.

I've read quite a bit of literature from queer and trans authors, but very little of it has felt like the experiences portrayed contained within have mirrored my own. So much of my life - especially post transition - has come with this sense of 'other'. The way people treat me is often informed by my transness more than anything else.

> The way people react, I know that they are thinking about what they would call my gender and, in the way most people find gender and bodies to be irredicibly the same, that they are thinking also of my body, ... I know that when I am talking to a large group of people, in their heads are odd confusions about me, and that when I am talking on-on-one, a slight nervousness sometimes - the fear that they will say the wrong thing, and their language will reveal how they see me.

The quick glances at my chest while using 'he, sorry, she, sorry, they'. Referring to me only by name to avoid using pronouns and opening themselves up to mistake and possible critique (im so tired and rarely bother to correct people these days).

*"I can see we are all scared by what we aren't saying"*.

Its a strange thing, to feel so powerless in these situations and yet see people are scared of how they interact with you.
