# Get in the meat suit ~~shinji~~ brain 

So my psych recently asked when was the last time I felt like I made a major decision about my life with myself as the main priority... and uhhhhh... yeah...

the answer is probably transition, maybe moving back to Adelaide, buying my house?

I think it's often easier to avoid putting myself first because that means I have to take sole responsibility and accountability for my actions. not that I shouldn't or dont do that otherwise, but its easier to justify a decision when it doesn't feel completely self driven. you don't have to regret going one path instead of another if someone is holding your hand while you do it. [Is it subjugation](https://www.attachmentproject.com/early-maladaptive-schemas/subjugation/), [is it self sacrifice](https://www.attachmentproject.com/early-maladaptive-schemas/self-sacrifice/) who knows??? (it's both it's absolutely both 🙃)

what the fuck do I want? im exhausted all the time, I want things to change?? idk I met someone recently who I absolutely have a crush on, and it's put some aspects of my current relationship into a different perspective. i don't want to run away and build a life with this person, but the self confidence they seem to have about the way they live and the decisions they make is aspirational. and... idk I feel kind of seen? but my partner also makes me feel seen and loved and supported and I'm still so resentful about feeling like I've lost years of my life to caring. but they feel similarly about being cared for... neither of us are wrong to feel this way

is there a way back? so much of my trepidation is shame and guilt about feeling like this and having a partner who is sick. what kind of monster would be feel like this?? would we have stayed together if they hadn't gotten sick?? would I have just done the same thing but with someone else?? am I a fundamentally broken person??
